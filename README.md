# 🐐 G.O.A.T. 

Groundbreaking Oracle Aggregator Technology (in short, GOAT) is a decentralized oracle aggregator service. GOAT allows token holders access to selected oracles. Users can mint or rent an NFT, which then can be connected to a smart contract to access the oracle's data feeds. This solution is innovative as it allows end users to access different oracle providers trough a single source (GOAT). 

⚙️ Built using Solidity, NextJS, Hardhat, and Typescript.

- 📃 **Smart contracts**: Using ERC721A, ERC4907A and ERC6982.
- 🔮 **Connected to oracles**: End users can access different oracles via GOAT.
- 💰 **Fair pricing for oracle providers**: GOAT's demand based pricing will make sure providers will receive a fair market price.
