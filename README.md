# üêê G.O.A.T.

Groundbreaking Oracle Aggregator Technology (in short, GOAT) is a tokenized oracle aggregator service that allows token holders access to selected oracles using a single source. In this way, oracle protocols can monetize their data providing services and users can mint or rent an NFT, which then can be connected to a smart contract to access the oracle's data feeds. This solution is innovative as it opens up a marketplace of decentralized data providers and allows for different mechanics such as time-limited renting, trust-based supply management, hierarchical oracle aggregation (ERC-6150).

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Solidity, NextJS, Hardhat, and Typescript.

- üìÉ **Smart contracts**: Using ERC721A, ERC4907A and ERC6982.
- üîÆ **Connected to oracles**: End users can access different oracles in one place (i.e. GOAT smart contract).
- üí∞ **Fair pricing for oracle providers**: GOAT's demand based pricing will make sure providers will receive a fair market price.
- üñºÔ∏è **NFT-based access** Trade or rent different data feeds from various providers on NFT marketplaces.

## Hackathon bounties

#### Chronicle

- Our use-case is innovative and interesting for Chronicle Protocol as it provides oracle providers a way to monetize their services in a fair and demand-based way. Also it makes it oracles more accessible, aggregating them in a single place is a huge UX improvement for users. Chronicle Oracle is integrated into project using Oracles on Sepolia.
